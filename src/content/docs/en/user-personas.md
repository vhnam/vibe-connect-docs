| **Pain Points**               | **1.** Worry about personal data being exploited by tech companies. **2.** Opposes any form of surveillance.                                                                         | Needs a clear notification: **"Parental Monitoring features only apply to linked users under 18."** |
| **Value Sought**              | **Trust:** Needs an app that is **not** a government/corporate surveillance tool.                                                                                                    | Features must function flawlessly without lag; safety features must be **completely bypassable**.   |

### Persona 4: SARAH – The Hands-Off Enforcer

| **Pain Points**               | **1.** The lack of transparency in social apps makes it difficult for her child to self-regulate. **2.** Does not want to give her child more reason to resist monitoring. | She needs the **least invasive solution**; she doesn't need detailed **Keyword Alerts** like David.                  |
| **Value Sought**              | **Basic Trust:** Trusts her child's judgment but needs a tool to enforce family rules.                                                                                     | The Premium package needs a **"Time Limit Only"** option at a lower price point.                                     |

| **Goals**                     | **Goal 1:** Feel **close** to her core friend group despite being far away. **Goal 2:** Share new, unique experiences from a different location.                 | The **Location Map** feature becomes a core value, helping her feel "present" in both places. |
| **Pain Points**               | **1.** Feeling left out or disconnected from the daily lives of friends back home. **2.** Normal chat apps do not convey the spatial experience.                 | The app must automate location and photo updates, minimizing the effort to connect.           |
| **Value Sought**              | **Synchronicity:** Wants to naturally feel the friends' "Vibe," just as if she were near them.                                                                   | Needs a map feature that works smoothly with international time zones and locations.          |
| **Behavior with VibeConnect** | She will frequently use **VibeConnect** as a "window" into her friends' lives, and also use it to quickly share interesting places she visits.                   |                                                                                               |

### Persona 6: GRANDMA CHEN – The Passive Observer

Grandma Chen represents the group who want to maintain intimate connection with family without complex interaction. This Persona reinforces the **View-Only** feature and **product extensibility** of VibeConnect.

| Information                   | Details                                                                                                                                                                                        | Relevance to VibeConnect                                                                                                  |

| **Demographics**              | **Age:** 70+. **Occupation:** Retired. **Location:** Living independently or in a retirement home. **Technology:** Uses a smart TV, simple tablet, or **digital photo frame**.                 | Needs a **View-Only** app that is easy to install once and **auto-runs**.                                                 |
| **Goals**                     | **Goal 1:** Feel the **warmth** and **daily presence** of her children and grandchildren (especially Maya). **Goal 2:** Not need to learn how to use a complex app.                            | The interface must be **extremely minimal**, showing only photos. No photo sending button, no settings.                   |
| **Pain Points**               | **1.** Feeling lonely when children/grandchildren are far away. **2.** The process of interacting with a smartphone (unlocking, opening app, finding photos) is too difficult and complicated. | The app must function as a **continuous photo stream** (live feed) from the close group without requiring interaction.    |
| **Value Sought**              | **Maximum Simplicity:** The photo frame must work without daily maintenance or interaction.                                                                                                    | Needs a **Web View** (Phase 1) or **Native View-Only App** (Phase 2) with casting capability or running on large devices. |
| **Behavior with VibeConnect** | She will not directly download the app, but her children/grandchildren (David/Maya) will **install and activate** it for her. She only observes the photos flowing by.                         | This is an **Add-on** or a new **Premium Tier**, sold to David/Sarah but serving Grandma Chen.                            |
