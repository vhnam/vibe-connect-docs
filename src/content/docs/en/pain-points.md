| Area                         | Underserved Need (Pain Point)                                                                                                                                         | Persona Most Affected   | How VibeConnect Solves It                                                                             |

| **1. Social Experience**     | **Pressure for Perfection:** Current social apps force users to edit and pose, leading to inauthenticity.                                                             | Maya                    | Focus on **Instant Camera** and **No Filter Policy**.                                                 |
| **2. Speed & Interface**     | **Sharing Latency:** The process of opening the app, taking a photo, and uploading takes too long, losing the _instant_ nature of the moment.                         | Maya, Chloe             | **Instant Update Widget** and **Super-Fast Camera Interface**.                                        |
| **3. Privacy & Trust**       | **Data Mistrust:** Fear that personal data will be permanently stored and exploited commercially/tracked by the government.                                           | Liam                    | **Automatic Data Deletion** from the server after 48-72 hours and **Transparent Privacy Commitment**. |
| **4. Parental Control**      | **Binary Choice:** Parents can only choose between **Overly Intrusive Monitoring** or **No Control at All**.                                                          | David, Sarah            | Offering optional monitoring levels: **Keyword Alerts** (David) vs. **Time Limits Only** (Sarah).     |
| **5. Long-Distance Connect** | **Unreliable/Battery-Draining Location:** Other map apps drain battery and are often inaccurate when crossing time zones/borders.                                     | Chloe                   | **Optimized Location Map** for stable and global accuracy and performance.                            |
| **6. Elderly Support**       | **Technology Barrier:** Elderly individuals want to connect but are hindered by **complex interfaces**, **difficult interaction**, and the need to learn new actions. | **Grandma Chen**        | **View-Only Mode** and **Digital Photo Frame UI** (no interaction required).                          |
| **7. Safety Experience**     | **Lack of Simple Emergency Feature:** No fast and easy way to **activate emergency alerts** to family members.                                                        | David, **Grandma Chen** | Easily accessible **SOS Button** within the Parent/Guardian Interface (or View-Only Interface).       |
