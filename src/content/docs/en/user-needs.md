## Key Design Conclusions

1.  **Must-Have Features (MVP):** **Speed (I.1)** and the **Widget (II.3)** must be the top two priorities, as they satisfy Maya's core needs.
2.  **Competitive Advantage:** The combination of **Automatic Data Deletion (III.1)**, **Keyword Alerts (V.1)**, and **View-Only Mode (II.4/I.3)** is a unique selling point to attract Liam, David, and expand to the elderly segment (Grandma Chen) simultaneously.
3.  **Monetization & Product Expansion Strategy:**
    - **Time Limit features (V.2)** must be designed to serve both David (premium) and Sarah (basic/free).
    - **View-Only Mode** for Grandma Chen (for use on Digital Photo Frames/Tablets) can be sold as an **Add-on** or a **Family Premium Tier** (purchased by David/Sarah for the elderly user).
4.  **UX Requirement for the Elderly:** The design must account for an **Alternative UI** that allows the app to function effectively as a **digital photo frame**, with **zero interaction required** and only one large button for **SOS** (V.5).
